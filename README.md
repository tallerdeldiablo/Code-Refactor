# Refactor code

## Description


The purpose of this project is to improve the HTML and the CSS code with the goal to make it more accessible.

"Accessible" means that people with disabilities can navigate through the page with the same opportunity as people without disabilities.

I built this project because it is very important to me that people with disabilities have access to online resources without having to rely on others for assistance. There are so many technologies available these days to improve accessibility, so I believe that all websites should be compatible from the start.

Having friends with disabilities, I know first hand that many websites and online services do not have the disabled in mind, limiting their access unnecessarily.
